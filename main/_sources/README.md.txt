## Installation

<!--start galaxy_download -->
### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation.amq

<!--end galaxy_download -->


### Build and install locally

Clone the repository, checkout the tag you want to build, or pick the main branch for the development version; then:

    ansible-galaxy collection build .
    ansible-galaxy collection install middleware_automation-amq-*.tar.gz


### Dependencies

#### Ansible collections:

* [middleware_automation.common](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/common)
* [ansible.posix](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/index.html)


The dependencies will be installed automatically when installing the collection with ansible-galaxy, or to install manually use:

    ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml


#### Python:

* lxml
* jmespath

To install all the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Install Playbook

* [`playbooks/activemq.yml`](https://github.com/ansible-middleware/amq/blob/main/playbooks/activemq.yml) deploys based on the collections defaults.


#### Controller node install zipfile path

By default the collection will download the desired version of the install zipfile to the ansible controller node, then it will distribute to target nodes.
The variable `activemq_local_archive_repository` controls the path on the controller where the install zipfiles will be located, and by default will be the playbook working directory.


#### Offline from controller node

Making the install zipfile archive available to the playbook working directory, and setting `activemq_offline_install` to `True`, allows to skip
the download tasks. The local path for the archive does match the downloaded archive path, so that it is also used as a cache when multiple hosts are provisioned in a cluster.

```yaml
activemq_offline_install: True
```


<!--start rhn_credentials -->
<!--end rhn_credentials -->


#### Clustered / high availability deployments

When deploying clustered configurations, all hosts belonging to the cluster must be present in `ansible_play_batch`; ie. they must be targeted by the same ansible-playbook execution.
